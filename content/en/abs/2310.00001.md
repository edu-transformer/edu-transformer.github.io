### Tech's Rapid Growth: A Challenge for Humanity

Tristan Harris discusses the rapid growth of technology, especially artificial intelligence (AI) and social media's impact. Highlighting a challenge, he cites EO Wilson, a renowned sociobiologist, who said:

> *"The real problem of humanity is that we have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and god-like Technology."* 

This quote underscores the gap between our basic emotions, old institutions, and powerful modern tech.
