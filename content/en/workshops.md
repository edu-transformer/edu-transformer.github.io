ChatGPT has sparked a debate on how modern education should adapt to the rapidly changing reality.

Participants of the debate at [SLO5](https://slo5.edu.pl/) high school concluded: The topic of Artificial Intelligence (AI) needs to be introduced into the curriculum. The nature of homework should change, and awareness should be raised. AI will not replace full engagement in learning.{{< sup "1" "./#1" >}}

The next step was **workshops for teachers**.
* **Before the workshops**: Each teacher chose their 'most boring lesson topic'.
* **During the workshops**: We used ChatGPT to transform the chosen topics into more engaging and appealing ones for the teachers.   
* **Duration**: 2-3h. 

The workshops helped overcome barriers, influenced homework, and raised AI awareness.{{< sup "2" "./#2" >}}{{< sup "3" "./#3" >}}

* Don't pretend there's no problem and that things will remain as they were…
* The foundation of school is trust, independence, and responsibility.
* Planning and integrating AI into the curriculum – showcasing its pros and cons, opportunities, and threats. Introducing topics in the first grade in computer science, but not only. This year we did it in the second semester of the third grade in computer science P – it's definitely too late!
* Changing the nature and amount of homework.
* Working on the awareness that AI won't write our final exams for us, nor will it study and work for us later...
* Mutual respect for our time – the teacher's time, the student's time... If we deceive each other, everyone will lose.

* It's worth setting up ChatGTP accounts in advance (it took ~0.5h).
* When starting a conversation with ChatGPT, it's good to introduce yourself.
* We used 'Zero Shot', 'Few Shot', and 'Chain-Of-Thought' techniques.
* The scope of using GPT can be extended beyond 'boring lessons', e.g., for lesson preparation.
