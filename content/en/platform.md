We're building a publishing platform. Think academic journals, but way simpler.

- **Your Piece**: Go solo or team up. Share your work and let others build upon it. 

- **How to Draft?**: Describe a problem, showcase your results, then hint at possible uses. As for length? You decide.

- **For Instance**: How about leveraging ChatGPT to make a tough topic engaging?

- **After Submission**: No grades here! Just checking for fit with our project goals and general standards.
